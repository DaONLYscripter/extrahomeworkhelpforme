Website is almost done! Just need a little clean up on the Proxies and where they go. Like said before if the proxies do not work Dont put them in the Storage. 
Also, I might try to get someone that does coding to join us and try to clean this up. Just letting you know. 


Bookmarklets 
javascript:(function () {let code = document.createElement('script');code.src = 'https://crownjs.anirudhiscool.repl.co/script.js';document.body.appendChild(code);}())
Crown Js steps 
1. Open new tab 
2. Click the star in the top right corner 
3. CLick More
4. Delete the second box that has the actuall url for new tab then put it javascript:(function () {let code = document.createElement('script');code.src = 'https://crownjs.anirudhiscool.repl.co/script.js';document.body.appendChild(code);}())  <--- That
go to a diffrent website or something thats not new tab
then open your bookmark... Then enjoy! 

Or the alternate way is to go here https://crownjs.anirudhiscool.repl.co/ (but its detected)

I honestly think we need to have lessons because Splex you dont know what your doing neither do you xavier. i dont wanna be rude, but go to the 3 lines at the top left and go to learn and im going to also and just do those tutorials and stuff like that. Im joining with yall i need a little recap and also i have a website to if yall dont like the learning circullim on replit i think in my opinion both are more easier but the website goes simple and straight foward.
